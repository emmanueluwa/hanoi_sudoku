## Tower of Hanoi Puzzle

The *Tower of Hanoi*, also known as the *Benares Temple problem* or *Lucas' Tower*, is a classic mathematical game comprising three rods and various-sized disks. The disks start on one rod, forming a stack, and the goal is to move the entire stack to another rod while following specific rules:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- Each move involves taking the uppermost disk from a stack and placing it on top of another stack or an empty rod.
- A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The puzzle's objective is to complete the task in the minimum number of moves. For a *Tower of Hanoi* puzzle with three disks, it can be solved in seven moves, while the general formula for the minimum moves needed is `2^n - 1`, where `n` is the number of disks.


I am using this challenge to familiarise myself with recursion.
